collect.js is a simple script that extracts all localizable strings from a 
CHT file and prints them as a JSON object that can be edited to create a 
correct NLS bundle for this CHT module. 

Usage: node release/collect.js FileName.cht >NLSFileName.js

Note that results are always directed to standard output.

In order to build release/collect.js script from the source: 

1. Download the trunk version of Dojo from http://svn.dojotoolkit.org
2. Change directory to util/buildscripts of Dojo trunk
3. Run "./build.sh --release --profile <<Path to collect.profile.js>>
4. Copy or move release/dojo/dojo/dojo.js from Dojo trunk directory to 
   release/collect.js in this directory.
