collect.js is a simple script that extracts all localizable strings from a 
CHT file and prints them as a JSON object that can be edited to create a 
correct NLS bundle for this CHT module. 

Usage: rhino release/collect.js FileName.cht >NLSFileName.js

Note that results are always directed to standard output.

Until the process of building standalone command line utilities that use 
Dojo becomes reasonably stable, it is recommended to use the pre-built
version of the utility in the release directory and not the script source.
