collect.js is a simple script that extracts all localizable strings from a 
CHT file and prints them as a JSON object that can be edited to create a 
correct NLS bundle for this CHT module. 

Usage: (*) unpack collect.zip in place
       node release/dojo/collect.js FileName.cht >NLSFileName.js

Note that results are always directed to standard output.

In order to build release/collect.js script from the source: 

(*) Don't even try if you value your sanity :( Dojo build framework does not
    seem capable of producing builds for Node.js in a straightforward manner.
    I am despaired of seeing this issue resolved in my lifetime.
