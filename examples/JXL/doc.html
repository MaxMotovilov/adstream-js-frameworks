	<h1>Introduction to jtlc</h1>

	This document provides a brief description of <strong>jtlc</strong> (<strong>J</strong>avascript
	<strong>T</strong>emplate <strong>L</strong>anguage <strong>C</strong>ompiler) &mdash; an infrastructure
	for creating declarative templates compiled into Javascript code &mdash; as well as <strong>JXL</strong>
	(<strong>J</strong>SON Transformation <strong>L</strong>anguage) &mdash; a specific template language 
	implemented with jtlc for transforming and re-shaping JSON data. At the moment the two
	concepts are very much intertwined and may be considered one and the same; the author does, however, expect
	to see &mdash; and come up with &mdash; template languages with different syntax and purpose built on
	jtlc infrastructure.

	<h2>Usage model</h2>

	The jtlc is designed around the two-stage model of template execution: first, the template is compiled
	into a Javascript function with a call to <strong>dojox.jtlc.compile</strong>(<em>template</em>,
	<em>language</em>) where <em>language</em> is an object instance encapsulating both the specifics
	of the template language and the optional setting selected by the user. The returned evaluator function 
	may then be executed as many times as necessary on different inputs. Structure of the input and output 
	data for the template depends on the language; JXL treats both as anonymous (i.e. without a custom 
	constructor) Javascript objects and arrays in keeping with the philosophy of JSON. 

	<h2>Performance</h2>

	The primary reason behind the two-stage execution model is performance: the code compiled from templates
	should generally be expected to compare well to handwritten Javascript in the efficiency of execution.
	Care is taken to avoid or minimize spurious copying, use efficient loop constructs, evaluate complex
	subexpressions once etc. All data structures maintained during the execution of the template remain 
	under direct control of the template's programmer: the compiler introduces only local variables and no
	additional arrays or objects. Turning on optional argument checks may lead to introduction of function
	calls to contexts where default settings produce only inline code: choosing uncompromising performance
	vs. timely detection of errors in input data is a tradeoff left to the user of the library.
	
	<h1>Introduction to JXL</h1>

	JXL is similar in purpose to XSLT: it provides a concise notation describing the transformation
	of one JSON structure into another. The language itself is also based on Javascript object notation but
	it is not JSON compliant: aside from the primitive types and object and array literals it also requires
	the use of functional <strong>tags</strong> which expand into non-anonymous &mdash; and invisible
	to the user of the library &mdash; Javascript objects.

	<h2>Execution model</h2>

	The execution of a JXL template is best described in terms of the dataflow programming model: values are
	<em>generated</em> by some primitives, are operated upon by others resulting in new values and end up
	in <em>sinks</em> provided by a third kind of primitives. The behavior of most languages entities depends 
	on whether they appear in a context of a <em>singleton</em> or an <em>iteration</em>:

	<h3>Singleton context</h3>

	In singleton context only a single value is processed. All primitives with parameters operate as functions
	insofar as they have no side effects.

	<h3>Iterative context</h3>

	In iterative context the values are produced in sequence by the innermost generator, undergo processing 
	imposed by the primitives enclosing the generator and ultimately end up in a sink which limits the context.
	Array is the most typical sink for the iterative contexts though it is also possible to populate dictionaries
	(anonymous Javascript objects) iteratively or aggregate the results to a single value. The generators
	typically iterate over arrays passed in as template's arguments, produced by executing a query over input
	data or built by other parts of the same template; it is also possible to iterate over keys in a dictionary.

	<h2>Usage examples</h2>

	As JXL was designed to build upon and extend the capabilities provided by <strong>dojox.json.query</strong>
	rather than as a replacement for the latter library, the examples in this section concentrate on use cases
	where <strong>dojox.json.query</strong> in itself is not sufficient to do the job. The author hopes that
	simpler patterns of JXL use can be easily derived from these examples by the reader.

	<h3>Grouping</h3>

	<div class='example' id='Grouping_example_1'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	Note that strings <strong>"author"</strong>, <strong>"$[0].author"</strong> and <strong>"[/author]"</strong> 
	are implicitly treated as expressions and a query, respectively, based on the execution context. At the
	same time, string <strong>"title"</strong> requires an explicit tag around it since it appears in an iterative
	context. <p>Using <strong>$[0]</strong> in an expression within group body is an easy way to access the key 
	fields as they are equal for the entire group anyway and the group is guaranteed to have at least one element.
	Simple expressions referencing the properties of the current input do not have <strong>"$."</strong> in front
	of the name as it is implicitly assumed by <strong>expr()</strong>.

	<div class='example' id='Grouping_example_2'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	For optimal performance, only one sorting on a composite key occurs here. The inner <strong>group()</strong> 
	operates on the	current value (sequence of records with identical <strong>continent</strong> key) of the outer 
	one so it does not need the third argument.

	<h3>Aggregation</h3>

	<div class='example' id='Aggregation_example_1'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>
	
	In this example, using an object literal at JXL level to form the output records is not possible since it 
	establishes an execution context of its own. Hiding it inside an expression solves the problem for simple
	cases. More complex aggregation patterns may require external accumulators implemented using an object or
	a closure:

	<div class='example' id='Aggregation_example_2'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	Here, <strong>each()</strong> is used to evaluate the object literal for each input array element (iteration
	over current input is assumed by <strong>each()</strong> when it is given only one argument).

	<h3>Flattening nested arrays</h3>

	<div class='example' id='Flattening_example_1'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	Again, it is much easier to move object construction inside the inline expression than to deal with an
	object literal with a context of its own.

	<div class='example' id='Flattening_example_2'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	Note that the second expression does create an intermediate copy: it is necessary to pass multiple properties
	to the innermost iteration. This copy however is shallow and performance impact of it should be minimal.

	<h3>Transforming dictionaries</h3>

	<div class='example' id='Dictionary_example_1'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	The example above takes a simple record and transforms it into a data structure suitable to populate
	the names and values for controls in a form template.

	<h3>Simple joins</h3>

	At the moment, JXL lacks comprehensive support for SQL-like joins. Nevertheless some simple yet important
	cases &mdash; such as lookup by an unique key &mdash; can be implemented in a straightforward manner:

	<div class='example' id='Join_example_1'><div></div><div></div><div></div></div>

	The association of the two tables relies on an intermediate dictionary with the key field of the join serving
	as the key in the dictionary. The same approach can be extended to compound keys by using <strong>replace()</strong>
	to build their string representations.

	<h1>JXL and jtlc reference</h1>

	<h2>dojox.jtlc.compile</h2>
	
	<blockquote>compile( <em>template</em>, <em>language</em> )</blockquote>

	Accepts template as its first argument and language description (such as an instance of dojo.jtlc.JXL) as
	its second argument. Returns the compiled evaluator function for the template or throws an exception in
	case of errors.

	<h2>dojox.jtlc.JXL</h2>

	<blockquote>new JXL( <strong>{</strong> <em>setting</em>... <strong>}</strong> )</blockquote>

	Instantiates language description for JXL that can be customized by specifying the following settings:

	<dl>
		<dt>elideNulls
		<dd>When <strong>true</strong>, null values are not placed into array or dictionary sinks but are thrown
		away instead (with their corresponding keys in case of a dictionary).
		<dt>failOnDuplicateKeys
		<dd>When <strong>true</strong>, an attempt to insert a duplicate key into the dictionary sink results in
		an exception.
		<dt>singletonQuery.failOnNoResults
		<dd>Set to <strong>true</strong> to verify that queries in singleton contexts produce at least one result
		or throw an exception otherwise.
		<dt>singletonQuery.failOnManyResults
		<dd>Set to <strong>true</strong> to verify that queries in singleton contexts produce no more than one result
		or throw an exception otherwise.
		<dt>queryLanguage
		<dd>By default this option is set to <strong>dojox.json.query</strong>. You may substitute a query language
		compiler with compatible API.
		<dt>replaceLanguage
		<dd>By defualt this option is set to <strong>dojo.replace</strong>. You may substitute a formatting function
		of your own with compatible API.
	</dl>

	Note that default settings always favor performance over other concerns; turning on additional checking in the
	code is likely to make it somewhat more complex and, as a result, slower.

	<h2>JXL literals</h2>

	<h3>Object literals</h3>

	<blockquote><strong>{</strong> <em>key0</em>: <em>input0 [</em>, ...<em>keyN</em>: <em>inputN]</em> <strong>}</strong></blockquote>

	Object literals are sinks producing dictionaries (anonymous Javascript objects). By default, all inputs
	of an object literal are evaluated in singleton mode and the resulting values inserted into the resulting
	dictionary with literal key values. In order to populate a dictionary with keys generated from an input
	sequence, use the <strong>setkey()</strong>	primitive from a sub-template enclosed within 
	<strong>many()</strong>. In this case the key associated with this sub-template within the literal will be 
	ignored and the computed value will be used instead.

	<h3>Array literals</h3>

	<blockquote><strong>[</strong> <em>input0 [</em>, ...<em>inputN]</em> <strong>]</strong></blockquote>

	Array literals are sinks producing anonymous Javascript arrays. By default, each input of an array literal
	is evaluated in an iterative context of its own. In order to evaluate a singleton sub-template and put its
	value in an array, enclose the sub-template within <strong>one()</strong>.

	<p>Note that array literals themselves are not generators and should not appear in an iterative context
	even though they establish an iterative context of their own inside the brackets. In order to use the value
	produced by an array literal as a generator, enclose it in <strong>from()</strong>.

	<h3>String literals</h3>

	String literals may appear in place of a sub-template anywhere in JXL. They are interpreted differently
	depending on the context: in the context of a singleton, the string is taken to be an inline expression
	as if it were enclosed in an <strong>expr()</strong> tag. In an iterative context, the string is assumed
	to be a query without additional parameters, which is to say, an equivalent of <strong>query(</strong> 
	<em>string</em>, <strong>current() )</strong>.

	<h3>Numeric and boolean literals</h3>

	Numeric and boolean literals are always interpreted as if they were enclosed in <strong>quote()</strong>.
	Consequently they may not appear in an iterative context.

	<h3>Functions</h3>

	Values with the type of <strong>function</strong> are treated as if they were enclosed in <strong>bind()</strong>.

	<h2>JXL tags</h2>

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.acc</h3>

	<blockquote>acc( <em>input</em> )</blockquote>

	Ensures that the value of its argument (usually a constant) is stored in a local variable (accumulator). 
	Usually used as part of an aggregation construct such as <strong>expr(</strong> '$1+=<em>expression</em>', 
	<em>input</em>, <strong>acc(</strong>0<strong>) )</strong>. It is not an error to use <strong>acc()</strong>
	in an iterative context but the tag will have no effect as the accumulator will be overwritten by the next
	iteration.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.arg</h3>

	<blockquote>arg( <em>index</em> )</blockquote>

	Returns one of the arguments passed into the evaluator of the template. While <strong>current()</strong>
	defaults to iterating over <strong>arg( </strong>0 <strong>)</strong>, the two are not equivalent: 
	<strong>arg()</strong> is not a generator and should be enclosed in <strong>from()</strong> to produce
	one. The argument of <strong>arg()</strong> should be a numeric value (usually a constant).

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.bind</h3>

	<blockquote>bind( <em>function [</em>, <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Evaluates the <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN</em> arguments, then applies <em>function</em> to them. In
	the iterative context, <em>input0</em> is treated as the generator, the rest of the arguments are 
	evaluated only once. If the <em>input</em> arguments are omitted completely, <strong>bind()</strong>
	assumes that the function should be applied to <strong>current()</strong>.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.current</h3>

	<blockquote>current()</blockquote>

	In a singleton context, returns the value of the current input. Current input defaults to the value of
	<strong>arg(</strong>0<strong>)</strong> but may be temporarily reset to different objects in a 
	sub-template enclosed in primitives such as	<strong>each()</strong>, <strong>group()</strong> and 
	<strong>setkey()</strong>. In an iterative context, <strong>current()</strong> serves as a generator
	of values from current input.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.defined</h3>

	<blockquote>defined( <em>[ input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Serves as a filter passing only the defined values (that is, values whose <strong>typeof</strong> is
	not equal to <strong>'undefined'</strong>) from the <em>input</em>. Should not be used outside of 
	iterative contexts.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.each</h3>

	<blockquote>each( <em>input0 [</em>, <em>input1</em>...<em>inputN ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Performs nested iterations by evaluating its first argument with current input set to the value 
	generated by the second argument and so on. Thus the rightmost argument forms the outermost
	iteration and the leftmost argument forms the innermost iteration. This primitive can only be used
	in iterative contexts and evaluates every one of its arguments in an iterative context of its own.
	Note that <strong>each()</strong> does not nest sinks, only the iterations. In fact, its usual
	application is flattening hierarchies formed by nested arrays passed into the template.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.expr</h3>

	<blockquote>expr( <em>expression [</em>, <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Evaluates its <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN</em> arguments, then evaluates the inline <em>expression</em>,
	substituting the values of the arguments for placeholders <strong>$</strong> and 
	<strong>$0</strong>...<strong>$9</strong> as follows:

	<dl>	
		<dt>$0...$9
		<dd>Values of <em>input0</em> through <em>input9</em>.
		<dt>$
		<dd>In singleton context, equivalent to <strong>$0</strong>. In an iterative context, current
		value generated by <em>input0</em>.
	</dl>

	If the expression contains no placeholder strings and begins with an identifier, <strong>expr()</strong>
	assumes it to be a property reference on the current input and prepends <strong>"$."</strong> to it.

	<p>If no <em>input</em> arguments are provided, the <em>expression</em> is evaluated with <em>input0</em>
	equal to current input. Note that <em>expr()</em> is entirely similar to <strong>bind()</strong> except that
	<strong>bind()</strong> refers to a function outside of the template's evaluator and <em>expr()</em>
	injects Javascript code directly into the evaluator's body.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.from</h3>

	<blockquote>from( <em>input</em> )</blockquote>

	Evaluates the <em>input</em> argument as a singleton and generates values from the array it returns as its 
	result. Applying <strong>from()</strong> to <strong>current()</strong> has no effect because 
	<strong>current()</strong> already serves as a generator in iterative contexts and <strong>from()</strong>
	cannot be used as a singleton.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.group</h3>

	<blockquote>group( <em>keys</em>, <em>body [</em>, <em>input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Provides SQL-like grouping capability by evaluating its <em>body</em> over subsequences from
	<em>input</em>. The subsequences are established by evaluating the <em>keys</em> (either a single
	sub-template or an array of subtemplates, typically inline expressions) over each element of the
	sequence and comparing the results. The longest contiguous subsequence of generated values where 
	<em>keys</em> are equal forms a group. The <em>body</em> is then evaluated with 
	current input set to the entire group. The <strong>group()</strong> primitive can be used only 
	in iterative contexts; it generates values returned by the <em>body</em>: one value per group. 

	<p>Note that for the grouping to work properly the <em>input</em> sequence should already be
	ordered in respect to the <em>keys</em> so usually <strong>group()</strong> is applied to the 
	results produced by a <em>query()</em>. However, the user is left free to group sorted sequences 
	originated elsewhere. If <em>input</em> argument is omitted, current input is used.	

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.keys</h3>

	<blockquote>keys( <em>[ input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Generates keys from the <em>input</em>: property names if <em>input</em> is an object, indices 
	if it is an array. If <em>input</em> is omitted, current input is used. Cannot be used outside
	of an iterative context.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.last</h3>

	<blockquote>last( <em>[ input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Serves as a special type of sink, returning only the last value generated by <em>input</em>. Usually
	used for aggregation purposes. If <em>input</em> is omitted, current input is used.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.many</h3>

	<blockquote>many( <em>input</em> )</blockquote>

	Evaluates its <em>input</em> in an iterative context if none exist already. If <em>many()</em>
	is used within an externally established iterative context it does nothing.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.one</h3>

	<blockquote>one( <em>input</em> )</blockquote>

	Evaluates its <em>input</em> in a singleton context even when used within an externally established
	iterative context (in which case <strong>one()</strong> effectively works as a generator
	returning a single value).

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.query</h3>

	<blockquote>query( <em>query [</em>, <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Executes a query over the specified inputs (each of the arguments <em>input0</em>...<em>inputN</em>
	is evaluated as a singleton). By default, the <em>query</em> is pre-compiled with 
	<strong>dojox.json.query</strong> and the resulting evaluator is associated with the compiled template 
	via a closure; changing the	<strong>queryLanguage</strong> setting allow the user to use a different 
	query language implementation following the same paradigm.

	<p>In iterative contexts, <strong>query()</strong> works as a generator returning individual 
	matches from the <em>query</em>. In singleton contexts <strong>query()</strong> assumes that one 
	and only one result should be produced, which is returned on its own. If <em>query</em> returns
	no matches, the result will have an "undefined" value; if <em>query</em> returns more than one
	match only the first one will be used. This default behavior may be modified with the settings
	<strong>singletonQuery.failOnNoResults</strong> and <strong>singletonQuery.failOnManyResults</strong>.

	<p>Using <strong>query()</strong> without the <em>input</em> arguments applies it to current input.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.quote</h3>

	<blockquote>quote( <em>value</em> )</blockquote>

	Treats <em>value</em> as a literal even if it is a Javascript object, array or string.

	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.replace</h3>

	<blockquote>replace( <em>format [</em>, <em>input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Formats and returns its <em>input</em> by performing substitutions within the <em>format</em> string.
	By default, <strong>replace()</strong> uses <strong>dojo.replace()</strong>; user can change this
	behavior with <strong>replaceLanguage</strong> setting. If the <em>input</em> argument is omitted,
	<strong>replace()</strong> works with current input.
	
	<h3>dojox.jtlc.tags.setkey</h3>

	<blockquote>setkey( <em>body [</em>, <em>input ]</em> )</blockquote>

	Changes the key (property name) under which computed values are stored in a dictionary. The <em>input</em>
	argument is evaluated first, then <em>body</em> is evaluated as a singleton with current input set to 
	the value returned by <em>input</em>; usually, the body consists of a <strong>replace()</strong>, possibly
	in combination with <strong>expr()</strong>. The result returned by the <em>body</em> is used as the key,
	the value from the <em>input</em> serves as the result of the <strong>setkey()</strong> itself. The 
	<strong>setkey()</strong> primitive can be used both within singletons and iterative contexts, but makes
	little sense in the former. Without the <em>input</em> argument, <strong>setkey()</strong> operates
	on the current input.
